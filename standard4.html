                        <h3>Content standard 4.0: Understanding Web Related Planning and Organizational Standards</h3>
                            <br/>
                            <div>
                                <p>Standard 4 covers the proccess of designing the layout, analyzing the audience, site organization and navigational layout. This also includes accesibility, as well as following the WCAG and section 508. The examples that cover these topics are the VRBO project and the Apple CSS recreation. Both of these follow the WCAG guidlines, provide various navigations, and both used a begining layou and are targeted towards a base audience.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.1: Demonstrate Understanding of Website Architecture and Planning</h3>
								<p>Section 4.1 covers the idea of designing with a team for a client. This requires one to develope an idea or story board that follows a clients ideas and wants, which also includes fulfilling the needs for their target audience. You need to know the goal of the content in order to optimize test results. When published, testing can be a key part to success to make sure that no bugs or errors are present that could displease the target audience.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.2: Demonstrate Understanding of Site Organization and Navigation Principles</h3>
								<p>Navigation is a key part of a succesful website, The three unique navs that I have developed are seen on the Apple site (image based Horizontal nav), the VRBO (vertical nav with rollovers), and the HTT wich is also a horizontal nav, but includes a JS nav extension. Being able to modify a nav with Js should be proper proof that I understand how to design and apply a nav to a site.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.3: Demonstrate Understanding of Website Accessibility Standards </h3>
								<p>Accesibility is a key part to reaching your target audience. Accesibility includes reading level, design, colors, TTS compatibility, and readable text. The Web Content Accesibility Guidelines as well as Section 508 standards gives a good idea as to what needs to be used, adn what shouldnt be used when designing a wbesite.</p>
