                            <br/>
                            <div>
                                <p>Standard 4 covers the process of designing the layout, analyzing the audience, site organization and navigational layout. This also includes accessibility, as well as following the WCAG and section 508. The examples that cover these topics are the VRBO project and the Apple CSS recreation. Both of these follow the WCAG guidelines, provide various navigations, and both used a beginning layout and are targeted towards a base audience.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.1: Demonstrate Understanding of Website Architecture and Planning</h3>
								<p>Section 4.1 covers the idea of designing with a team for a client. This requires one to develop an idea or story board that follows a clients ideas and wants, which also includes fulfilling the needs for their target audience. You need to know the goal of the content in order to optimize test results. When published, testing can be a key part to success to make sure that no bugs or errors are present that could displease the target audience.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.2: Demonstrate Understanding of Site Organization and Navigation Principles</h3>
								<p>Navigation is a key part of a successful website, The three unique navigations that I have developed are seen on the Apple site (image based Horizontal navigation), the VRBO (vertical navigation with rollovers), and the HTT which is also a horizontal navigation, but includes a JS navigation extension. Being able to modify a navigation with Js should be proper proof that I understand how to design and apply a navigation to a site.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 4.3: Demonstrate Understanding of Website Accessibility Standards </h3>
								<p>Accessibility is a key part to reaching your target audience. Accessibility includes reading level, design, colors, TTS compatibility, and readable text. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as well as Section 508 standards gives a good idea as to what needs to be used, and what shouldn't be used when designing a website.</p>
