                            <h3>Content standard 1.0: Understanding Web Page Development</h3>
                            <br/>
                            <div>
                                <p>Content standard 1 involves the basics of developing a website using HTML and CSS. All of these standards 1.1-1.3 can be demonstrated within various developed websites that I have created in the past. The examples listed below shows a CSS recreation of the Apple website,a s well as a video class project site that includes various transparencies and navigational design.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 1.1: Use Standards-Compliant HTML to Create Basic Web Pages</h3>
								<p>Address the basics of HTML, from creating a webpage, creating links and anchors, Headings, directory structure, and to the basics of file directories. Most webpages that I have developed and published follow all of these sections. Most of these topics cover the basic use fo html tags and file directory setup. Although, 1-8 address the creation and understanding of HTMl and how to actually create an HTML document in the first place. The websites linked below provide evidence that I have standard 1.1 mastered. </p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 1.2: Use Styles to Format Web Pages</h3>
								<p>Standard 1.2 applies to the beginning side of CSS, this includes starting from the differences between CSS and HTMl, to writing CSS, to understanding how to use and manipulate CSS. CSS can be used to easily and quickly modify and entire page of HTML by using classes, IDs, and tags to fulfil these goals. You can modify anything from the size and shape of a container, to what kind of font and font color you want. The site links below show that I have more than enough knowledge in CSS to master standard 1.2.  </p>
                                <br/>
                                <h3>standard 1.3: Demonstrate an Understanding of Advanced CSS Selectors and Properties </h3>
								<p>Standard 1.3 was about my knowledge of CSS and HTML at the beginning of Sophomore year. I understood how to divide my HTML, add Span tags, apply Pseudo-classes (a:hover), and apply the box model to various containers. By the end of sophomore year I would say that I easily mastered this section. Standard 1.1 and 1.2 both loop back into this, and build upon previously learned knowledge which has been applied throughout my various website projects over the past year and a half.</p>
